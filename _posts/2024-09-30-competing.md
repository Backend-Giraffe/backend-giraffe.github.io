I started Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) a little more than two years ago, approximately one month before my son was born. I guess I skipped training for a few weeks. After six to seven months of training I had my first competition. My coach is a still active competitor having already won gold in several european or world championships in his weight division. He is strongly encouraging us to compete in local tournaments or even the european championships.

From time to time the gym is arranging tournaments locally - which is a great opportunity to test your skills against real resistance. Travelling long distances can be an entry barrier for many as the schedule for a tournament is usually set only 2 days before the event. Even then changes in schedule are likely, due to athletes missing and fights ending early due to submissions. As a handful of my team mates from class were attending I was inclined to join, too. So I was about to have a my first fight.
I cannot remember anything from before the fight. I must have warmed up, nervously looking around, not really sure what to do.

The match started. What really shook me though was the force I felt, when my opponent grabbed my collar and pulled. I had never experienced such intensity during sparring before and I immediately knew that this was different. My response was to resist with equal force. We somehow ended up in open guard with me on top and I quickly passed guard and managed to get side control.
Again, I was surprised about the intensity at which my opponent was trying to get out of side control and I got swept (reversal of positions). We ended up in half-guard with me being the bottom player. We spent the majority of the round in this position and I was already gassed out - barely framing and keeping my opponent from passing. I felt like I was fighting for my life, while his corner was constantly in my ear as he got close to pass multiple times. The match ended 3:2 in my favor. My heart was pounding out of my chest, I could barely stand, my forearms were burning. If the referee would not have taken my arm and lifted it as you can see in image, I would not have been able to myself. My forearms were so burnt out that I was unable to make a fist. The coach recommend to pour cold water over them as my next match was already around the corner. I had maybe one or two matches in between until my next match. But I was done.

When the next match started my whole body felt heavy, I was exhausted. My opponent took me down quickly, passed around me and when he was about to pull on my arm for an armbar I already tapped as I was unable to resist anything. It was my opponents first match and he was still fresh. As this was a single elimination tournament, in which you can no longer continue after loosing one match - this was it. We were five in this whitebelt -94kg division and I scored the bronze medal.

Even though this first tournament felt terrifying in a way, I was proud, that I did pass my opponents guard and won the match. It was a great feeling to overcome my performance anxiety, nervousness and my opponent in general. The little cherry on top was to get a medal as a little reminder of what I have experienced.
