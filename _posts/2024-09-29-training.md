I am about to enter the last day of my unemployment phase and my new employer will require me to work
from office at least 3 days a week. I expect one journey to the office will take up to 50 minutes by car.
At the same time I am passionate a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) hobbyist (in the Gi) and I try
to keep up with tough individuals, that I am facing in competition and keep growing with my team mates in the gym.
Consequently, I train at home to strengthen my body and to prevent injury.

The past 3 years I have worked entirely from home and the lack of commuting long distances between office and home made it easy
to routinely do some calisthenics at home and take up to 3 BJJ classes a week. Ever since I have become
father of a beautiful son, which I cherish most, time has become a scarce resource, especially time in which I am able to perform
a fulfilling training routine. While a toddler brings the greatest of joys, he is also often sick as soon as child day care is entered
after parental leave, you have to entertain, teach, change diapers, and juggle all of the housework. Having a job and adequately caring
for a child - maybe even sneaking in some housework - is enough to take up all of the time and energy you get for the day.

The only reason I am able to train as much is that I can rely on my partner to take care the child, when I am out training.
To make up for it I try to get as much of the housework done in my remaining time. Long story short: In order to be able to train
I need to juggle time, energy and sleep so I can train and recover trom taxing BJJ sparring and calisthenics at home.

I have a set minimum goal to take 2 BJJ classes per week. Apart from that I train at home as it gives me a lot of flexibility
and I do not have to commute anywhere. I cannot afford to do long and exhaustive training sessions, because I want to still have
energy left for housework and family. I have come to the conclusion that I can currently only stick to consistent training, if I keep it
short and simple. As a result I established to do short sessions of 30 mins a day. I do bodyweight training only.
A session consists of a warm-up and a training circle of one push, one pull and one leg exercise aiming. The circle is repeated only up to 2 times. On
bad days I only do one set of each. Sometimes I add some 'accessory' exercises to the end. Any set is done to failure and I do not bother tracking repetitions.
During warm-up I need to prepare wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees and hips. The following table shows the exercises by weekday.


|                | Monday   | Tuesday  | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday   | Saturday | Sunday   |
|----------------|----------|----------|-----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Push**        |Push-up (wide grip)|Push-up (shoulder-wide grip)|Push-up (narrow grip)|Pike Push-up|Spiderman Push-up|Dips|Anything|
| **Pull**        |Pull-up (wide grip)|Pull-up (shoulder-wide grip)|Pull-up (hammer-grip)|Chin-ups|Rows|Pull-up (shoulder-wide grip)|Anything|
| **Legs**        |Pistol Squat|Cossack Squat|Lunges|Pistol Squat|Cossack Squat|Lunges|Squats|
| **Accessory**   |Nordic Curl & Tibialis Raise|Back Extension & Calf Raises|Nordic Curl & Tibialis Raise|Back Extension & Calf Raises|Nordic Curl & Tibialis Raise|Back Extension & Calf Raises|Anything|

In general, I avoid to do the same exercise 2 days in a row and try to perform each exercise only up to twice a week to target a wide range of muscle groups and avoid
overtraining the same muscles.
The goal is to do the training in the morning before commuting to work as I have read exercise in the morning might have positive impact on sleep.
I try to dedicate 15 minutes to warm-up and another 15 minutes for the circle, so I can attend work early enough to be able leave for BJJ class in time.
The book mentioning this was "Why we sleep" by Matthew Walker, I think. I allow myself to skip training entirely the next day, if I need more rest after hard sparring or I just really need the recovery.
