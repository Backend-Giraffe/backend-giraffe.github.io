I'm **Jan Evers**, a software engineer with a passion for natural language processing and functional programming. I have extensive experience working with programming languages like Scala, Python, and Java, and I thrive on building scalable, efficient solutions for complex systems. I take pride in my commitment to test-driven development and continuously honing my skills. Whether I'm developing microservices or tackling legacy code in monoliths, I bring a strong technical background and a dedication to delivering high-quality results.

Outside of work, I'm also a proud father, an occasional Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu competitor, and I enjoy immersing myself in strategy board games and PC games.
In case you are wondering: 'Giraffe' was a nickname bestowed upon me back in school, while software backend is where I feel most comfortable working with.
